![2023-09-10](https://github.com/amazeedaizee/NeedyGirlSeasons/assets/131136866/8e03be2c-a5f9-4696-b61b-381c505ea07c)


A mod that changes the background of the Webcam depending on the season.

Summer uses the default background.

Milestone streams, special streams like in Welcome To My Religion, and the pen-ultimate stream in the Internet Overdose ending are not affected.

### Note: You must have BepInEx pre-configured and enabled with the game to use this mod.
